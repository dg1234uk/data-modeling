# Querying Data

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/data-modeling-deep-dive/querying-data/intro-to-querying-data" />

<callout-info class="important">
	Starting with this exercise, we're going to start migrating away from our
	in-memory database to our SQLite database. Because our seed data for each is
	the same for the Kody user (including IDs), you'll find lots of the app
	appears to work even for parts that haven't been migrated yet! ðŸ˜† Just be
	aware of this if you notice some odd behavior (like deleting or editing a note
	and not seeing those changes reflected in the app, you deleted it from one
	database, but not the other! ðŸ˜…).
</callout-info>

With SQL, you query data using the `SELECT` statement. The `SELECT` statement is
one of the most complex statements in SQL, but it's also the most powerful. It's
used to query data from one or more tables. The `SELECT` statement is composed
of several clauses, but the two most important are the `FROM` and `WHERE`
clauses.

Let's start by looking at a simple `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user;
```

This will select everything from the user table. Let me state that again:

- This will select (`SELECT`)
- Everything (`*`)
- From (`FROM`)
- The user table (`user`)

<callout-warning>
	The semicolon at the end is required. I guess nobody told SQL about
	[ASI](https://kcd.im/semicolons) ðŸ˜†
</callout-warning>

Let's add a bit more:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email FROM user;
```

- This will select (`SELECT`)
- The id, name, and email columns (`id, name, email`)
- From (`FROM`)
- The user table (`user`)

## Where Clause

As mentioned earlier, the `WHERE` clause is one of the most important clauses in
a `SELECT` statement. It allows you to filter the data that's returned from the
database. Let's look at an example:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email FROM user WHERE id = 1;
```

- This will select (`SELECT`)
- The id, name, and email columns (`id, name, email`)
- From (`FROM`)
- The user table (`user`)
- Where (`WHERE`)
- The id column is equal to 1 (`id = 1`)

The `WHERE` clause makes it so the database will only return rows that match the
condition in the `WHERE` clause.

## Other clauses

There are quite a few other clauses that you can use in a `SELECT` statement.
You can find a comprehensive list of keywords like select clauses in
[the SQLite keyword documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_keywords.html),
and then you can search any that interest you in
[the SQLite docs search](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html).

<callout-info>
	If you ever see a SQL statement that's doing something you don't understand,
	you can paste it in [astexplorer.net](https://astexplorer.net) and select the
	SQL parser to see what different parts of the statement are called so you can
	look those things up.
</callout-info>

<callout-success>
	Next-level learning of SQL is to ask an AI assistant like
	[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to help you learn. Just be sure to
	double-check your work. But it should help guide you to the right answer.

## ORMs

SQL is a complex syntax that has a lot of power. There are professionals who see
the world in SQL (poor souls). But for the rest of us, we have ORMs. ORMs are
Object Relational Mappers. And that's what the Prisma Client is all about.
So instead of writing SQL queries by hand, we can use the Prisma Client to
generate and execute the SQL for us.

So, if we were to convert the SQL statement
`SELECT id, name, email FROM user WHERE id = 1;` into a prisma call, it would
look something like this:

```tsx
const user1 = await prisma.user.findUnique({
	where: { id: 1 },
	select: { id: true, name: true, email: true },
})
```

The declarative nature of this API maps relatively well to the SQL that you
would have written, so getting familiarity with SQL will help with using the
Prisma Client.

<callout-success>
	It's important to note that the Prisma Client is not a traditional ORM. It's
	an ORM-like API that generates and executes SQL for you. The objects you get
	back from the Prisma Client do not have methods you can call to do things like
	save them to the database (by default). Instead, you use the Prisma Client to
	do that. This is one way, the Prisma Client sheds some of the things I don't
	like about ORMs and keeps the things I do like about them.
</callout-success>

## Prisma Limitations

It should be mentioned that the Prisma Client isn't as powerful as SQL. There
are things that you may want to do which the Prisma Client cannot express. In
any typical application, you'll have a handful of cases like this (if any) and
in those cases, there's an API to drop down to SQL. We'll get to that in the
next exercise.

## Dealing with HMR

<callout-danger>
	Hot Module Replacement (HMR) means that every time we make a file change, our
	code is re-evaluated. This makes it so we can develop quickly, but it causes
	an issue we'll need to deal with.
</callout-danger>

When we create a new `PrismaClient` instance in our application, we create a new
connection to our database every time we make a change. Eventually, this will
cause our application to crash! So we need a workaround.

The workaround is simple: "If we've already created a `PrismaClient` instance,
let's use that one instead of creating a new one." Here's a simplified version
of what that would be like:

```tsx
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

if (!global.prisma) {
	global.prisma = new PrismaClient()
}

export const prisma = global.prisma
```

So we store our `PrismaClient` instance in a variable on `global` (which is
unchanged between re-evaluations of our server code), and then we check if it
exists before creating a new one. If it does exist, we'll use that one, if it
does not, then we create a new one.

While it is pretty simple, it also means that any change to the Prisma client
configuration will require a server restart. Luckily, we don't change our client
configuration that often, so this is a small price to pay for the benefits of
HMR.

We have a utility that helps us with this (it's annoying otherwise because
TypeScript doesn't love the `global.` stuff):

```tsx
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { singleton } from '#app/utils/singleton.server.ts'

export const prisma = singleton('prisma', () => new PrismaClient())
```

## Lazy connection

The Prisma Client will not connect to the database until it needs to. This means
your first query will take a bit longer than subsequent queries. This is
normally fine, but since we're confident we're going to need to start querying
the database quickly and connecting earlier doesn't cost anything, we can use
[the `$connect` method](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-management#connect)
to connect to the database as soon as possible.

```tsx
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { singleton } from '#app/utils/singleton.server.ts'

export const prisma = singleton('prisma', () => {
	const client = new PrismaClient()
	client.$connect();
	return client
})
```

## Logging

Prisma Client has a built-in logger that you can use to see what queries are
being executed. This is super helpful for debugging. You can also enable events
for queries so you can customize the logging. You can read more about that in
[the Prisma Client logging docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/logging).
